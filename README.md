# Ghost Emacs

<img src="ghost/logo.png" alt="logo" width="200"/>

This Emacs configuration aims to enhance the default Emacs expericine without requiring the user to go through a steep learning curve in order to enjoy using Emacs. It is heavily inspired by the [Howl editor](https://howl.io/) and uses the Monokai color theme. Ghost Emacs is degisned to be simple, based around [CUA Mode](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/CuaMode) keybinds, very few packages, and no external dependencies. 

## Installation

git clone https://github.com/TeaSkittle/ghost-emacs/ ~/.emacs.d
